Q: What is Boltzmann learning rule?

A: The Boltzmann learning rule is a stochastic learning algorithm derived from ideas rooted in statistical mechanisms.


Q: Name the characteristics of associative memory.

A: It is distributed, stimulus and response patterns consist of data vectors, information is stored in memory by setting up a spatial pattern of neural activities across a large number of neurons, information in stimulus determines its storage location and address of retrieval, high noise resistance, possibility of interaction between patterns in memory.


Q: In which learning form the process of learning never stops with learning going on while signal processing is being performed by a system?

A: In learning-on-the-fly or continious learning.
