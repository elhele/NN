Q: What is a perceptron convergance theorem?

A: It is a proof of convergence of the perceptron algorithm.

Q: Name and briefly describe the adaptive filter operation processes.

A: Filtering process - computations of output signal and error signal, adaptive process - automatic weights adjustment. The processes form a feedback loop.

Q: Name the characteristics of the linear-squares filter.

A: 1. A single neuron, around which the filter is built, is linear. 2. Cost function is a sum of error squares.
