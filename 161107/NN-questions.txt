Q: Of what consists the back propagation learning?

A: It consists of two passes through the different layers of the network: forward (activity pattern is applied to sensory nodes of the network, synaptic weights are fixed) and backward (synaptic weights are adjusting according to the error-correction rule).

Q: Name the distinctive characteristics of the multilayer perceptron.

A: 1. The model of each neuron in the NN includes a nonlinear activation function. 2. NN has one or more layers of hidden neurons. 3. The network shows high degree of connectivity.

Q: How to increase the learning rate and avoid instability?

A: We can modify delta rule by including a momentum term: Œîw_ji(n) = Œ±Œîw_ji(n - 1) + Œ∑ùõø_j(n)y_j(n) (generalized delta-rule).
